# SolBirthday
All files are required in this repo for SolBirthday.py to work. BUT, this application requires Python3.5, Matplotlib, Numpy, Datetime, SpiceyPy (and NASA SPICE toolkit), and PyQt5 to work. 

After this a simple '''python ./SolBirthday.py''' from terminal should get the gui going.

Enjoy!
